# Introduction to Ansible

## What is Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and IT orchestration. It enables system administrators and developers to automate repetitive tasks across multiple servers efficiently, using simple and human-readable YAML-based playbooks.

## Why Use Ansible?

- ‚ö° **Agentless Architecture**: No need to install agents on target machines; it uses SSH for communication.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Simplifies Automation**: Automate complex multi-tier IT application environments with ease.
- üìÑ **Human-Readable Playbooks**: Uses YAML syntax that is easy to write and understand.
- üîÑ **Idempotent Operations**: Ensures tasks only make changes when necessary, keeping systems consistent.
- üåê **Scalable**: Manage small setups or large-scale infrastructures seamlessly.
- ü§ù **Extensible**: Supports custom modules and plugins.

## How Ansible Works

1. **Control Node**: The machine where Ansible is installed and run.
2. **Inventory**: A list of managed nodes (hosts) defined in an inventory file.
3. **Modules**: Pre-built scripts that perform tasks like installing packages, copying files, or managing services.
4. **Playbooks**: YAML files that describe a series of tasks to be executed on target nodes.
5. **SSH Connection**: Ansible connects to nodes via SSH (or other transports) to execute tasks.

## Key Components of Ansible

### 1. **Inventory**
A file (usually `hosts`) listing managed nodes, either by IP or hostname, grouped logically.

### 2. **Modules**
Reusable, standalone scripts that perform actions on remote hosts (e.g., `yum`, `apt`, `service`, `copy`).

### 3. **Playbooks**
YAML files defining ordered sets of tasks (plays) run against hosts or groups.

### 4. **Roles**
Reusable, modular units of playbooks, files, and variables to organize automation.

### 5. **Tasks**
Individual actions executed on hosts, defined within playbooks.

### 6. **Handlers**
Special tasks triggered by notifications to restart or reload services after changes.

## Sample Playbook

```yaml
---
- name: Install and start Nginx on webservers
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Start Nginx service
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes
