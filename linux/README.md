# Introduction to Linux

## What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for a wide range of operating systems known as **Linux distributions** (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Fedora). These distributions include the Linux kernel along with software, libraries, and tools to form a complete operating system.

It powers everything from smartphones and servers to IoT devices and supercomputers.

## Why Use Linux?

- üÜì **Open Source & Free**: Available at no cost, with full access to the source code.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Stability & Performance**: Known for its reliability and efficient performance, especially in server environments.
- üîê **Security**: Regularly updated and highly secure when configured properly.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Developer-Friendly**: Includes powerful tools, scripting capabilities, and a customizable environment.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Widely Used in Servers & Cloud**: Dominates cloud infrastructure, web servers, and enterprise environments.

## Common Linux Distributions

- **Ubuntu** ‚Äì User-friendly, great for beginners
- **Debian** ‚Äì Stable and secure, parent of Ubuntu
- **CentOS / AlmaLinux / Rocky Linux** ‚Äì RHEL-based, used in enterprises
- **Fedora** ‚Äì Cutting-edge, used by developers
- **Arch Linux** ‚Äì Rolling release, highly customizable
- **Kali Linux** ‚Äì Security-focused, used for penetration testing

## Key Components of Linux

### 1. **Kernel**
The core of the operating system. It manages hardware, memory, processes, and system calls.

### 2. **Shell**
The command-line interface (e.g., `bash`, `zsh`) that interprets user commands.

### 3. **File System**
Linux uses a hierarchical file system starting from the root directory `/`.

### 4. **Package Manager**
Used to install, update, and remove software:
- `apt` (Debian/Ubuntu)
- `yum` or `dnf` (CentOS/Fedora/RHEL)
- `pacman` (Arch)

### 5. **User & Permissions**
Multi-user system with a powerful permission model to control access and security.

### 6. **Processes & Services**
Background tasks and active programs are managed through tools like `ps`, `top`, and `systemctl`.
