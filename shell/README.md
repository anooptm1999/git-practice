# Introduction to Shell and Shell Scripting

## What is Shell?

A **shell** is a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands. In Linux and Unix systems, the shell is an essential tool for navigating, managing files, and automating tasks.

Popular shells include:
- **Bash** (Bourne Again SHell) – default in most Linux distros
- **Zsh** – enhanced Bash alternative
- **Sh** – original Bourne shell
- **Fish** – user-friendly shell with smart auto-completion

## What is Shell Scripting?

A **shell script** is a file containing a series of commands written for the shell to execute. Shell scripts automate repetitive tasks like backups, software installations, and system monitoring.

Scripts are typically saved with a `.sh` extension and executed in the shell environment.
